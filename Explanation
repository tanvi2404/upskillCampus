### Home Automation Project: Arduino-Based System

 Components:
1. Arduino: Central controller, processing inputs from sensors and controlling outputs like LEDs and bulbs.
2. LED: Indicates status or events, such as motion detection.
3. Bulb: Controlled through a relay module to handle high voltage switching.
4. Resistor: Limits current to the LED, typically a 220-ohm resistor.
5. PIR Sensor: Detects motion, sends a HIGH signal to the Arduino when motion is detected.
6. Breadboard (Small): Platform for assembling the circuit, enabling easy connections.
7. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor: Measures distance using sound waves.
8. Temperature Sensor: Measures ambient temperature.

 Code Logic Outline:

Setup Function:
- Initialize serial communication for debugging.
- Set pin modes for all connected components.

Loop Function:
1. PIR Sensor: 
   - Check for motion. If motion is detected, turn on the LED and/or bulb.
2. Ultrasonic Sensor: 
   - Measure distance. If an object is within a specified range, perform an action (e.g., turn on a light).
3. Temperature Sensor: 
   - Read the temperature. If the temperature exceeds a threshold, take appropriate action (e.g., turn on a cooling fan).

This refined explanation maintains the core components and functionality, providing a clear structure for the home automation system.
